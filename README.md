# the-train-exchange
This project is for a website to allow model train enthusiasts to buy, sell, swap, or part exchange models from each other. 

## Background
Born out of conversations with fellow model train enthusiasts, this idea is to provide an online mechanism for model train enthusiasts to buy, sell, swap, or part exchange models from each other, without incurring the increasing fees that eBay imposes. The site will not be responsible for the financial transactions, but it will instead provide a mechanism to allow model trains available for sale or exchange to be searched for and allow initial contact between prospective buyers and sellers to be made.
