# the-train-exchange
This open-source project is to generate code for a website to allow model train enthusiasts to buy, sell, swap, or part exchange models from each other. 

The intention is for **The Train Exchange** to be created by railway/railroad modellers for railway/railroad modellers.

We are actively looking for [contributors](#contributers).

## Values
The values of the Train Exchange are below

* **T**rust (We aim to build a service where members can trust other members to be truthful about products they are selling or exchanging.)
* **R**espect (We respect all members)
* **A**ccess (We aim to provide easy access to this service)
* **I**nclusion (We include members from any race, gender, preference, or walk of life)
* **N**eutral (We do not follow any political agenda)

## Background
Born out of conversations with fellow model train enthusiasts, this idea is to provide an online mechanism for model train enthusiasts to buy, sell, swap, or part exchange models from each other, without incurring the increasing fees that eBay imposes. The site will not be responsible for the financial transactions, but it will instead provide a mechanism to allow model trains available for sale or exchange to be searched for and allow initial contact between prospective buyers and sellers to be made.

## Contributers
No project succeeds without contributors. for this project to succeed we will need contributors with the following skills:

* Project management
* Business Analysis
* Product Ownership
* Software Engineering (See technology stack below for specific development skills we need)
* Quality Assurance (Test plans, Manual Testing, user Acceptance Testing)

Are you a railway modeller with any of these skills, and some spare time? If so then we may need your help.

Feel free to raise issues but please review our [Definition Of Ready](././wiki/Definition-of-Ready) first.

## Sponsorship
We will need to host the website and the database and this costs money. We would be looking for model railway-related companies to provide funding for hosting, in return for targeted adverts on the site

## Technology Stack
The website will use the following technologies:

### Front End

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* JS template binding - React or Vue.js (Under discussion)

## Back End

* ASP.Net Core (C#)
* Web API
* Domain Driven Design
* SQL (Possibly SQL server)
